I applied scientific methods and operational processes to support the manufacturing of SARS-COV19 PCR tests
as well as tests for infectious diseases like MRSA and tuberculosis.
I also successfully implemented a Python-based automated documentation system, streamlining and improving
efficiency while reducing error in the record-keeping processes.

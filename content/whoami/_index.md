Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Timothy! I am a UC Berkeley Mathematician interested in web design and system administration. 

I got started in my career at Cepheid as a Reagent Production Analyst. I helped manufacture and analyze reagents that were critical to the production of COVID 19 PCR tests. 
There I learned a lot about bioinformatics algorithms and Python automation for streamlining and digitizing quality-check paperwork.

For my next adventure, I became a Mathematics tutor specializing in topics from algebra to calculus. My students come from different educational backgrounds, and often times I will say that
the script is flipped during sessions as the student becomes the teacher! 

Over time, my interests expanded into digital security and privacy as I dove into the world of self-hosting. I repurposed my old 2010 Macbook Pro into a Linux server and a spare Raspberry Pi into an 
ad-blocking DNS server utilizing DNS-over-TLS. From there I stumbled upon the world of capture-the-flag games in TryHackMe and OverTheWire. I am currently studying for the CCNA exam and hoping to start my career in IT.

Aside from that, I am the proud owner of a rescue dog (her name is Lexington!) and reading history and mathematics books as a hobby.
